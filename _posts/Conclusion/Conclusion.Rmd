The different articles in this blog expose the different ways in which we can use the properties of different wild yeasts or lab yeasts. 

Yeasts are required in the field of health to eradicate disease-carrying mosquitoes or as a production host for the synthesis of a molecule that prevents Alzheimer.

Yeast is also found in the industrial field in wild form to stimulate a bee colony or genetically modified to produce hydrogen or for the purification of water polluted by heavy metals. 

However, sometimes yeasts may be more effective than other organisms but not enough to replace it in factories.
