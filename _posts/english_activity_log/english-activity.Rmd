10/09/19 Today I used RStudio to see how the blog work
I also found a lot of articles in the site "nature.com" about yeasts, very interesting

10/20/19 I'm already looking for another article about yeasts in biotechnologies and especially in the food industry.

10/21/19 A new article appeared today, about yeast in the world of the beer this time.
I wasn't planning to talk about this subject but the hybridization of the yeast really interets me.

10/27/19 I have watched CNN News for 3 monts, i do not watch tv often but when i'm watching for tv, it's CNN yo follow the actuality.

10/30/19 Well, the article about beer and hybridation is now payable so i will not talk about beer for now.
But i'll probably talk about hybridization soon.
