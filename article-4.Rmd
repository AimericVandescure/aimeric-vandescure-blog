| General topic?               |  Researchers discovered a type of yeast *Sacchahromycopsis schoenii* which is able to destroy another type of multi-resistant yeast *Candida auris* by predation.    |
| Procedure/what was examined? | They sequenced, assembled and annoted a draft genome of S.schoenii to understand the predacious behaviour of the yeast and they observed living cells under a microscope   |
| Conclusions/discovery?       |  (what did the researchers conclude? Did they find something?)      |
| Remaining questions?         | What are they doing with the remaining yeasts *S. schoenii* ? |
